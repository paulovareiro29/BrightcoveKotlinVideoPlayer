Kotlin Video Player
======================

This is a sample application that puts together a list of Videos that can be reproduced using the
Brightcove Player SDK. The application uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture and uses
Android Architecture components like ViewModel and LiveData. Each View item is a Material Card View
and they are shown in a Recycler View. You can easily add more videos to the list by modifying the
player_plalist.json file in the assets folder. 7The network requests are executed using Kotlin
Coroutines.
